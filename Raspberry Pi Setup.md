### Raspberry Pi Setup

This guide is tested on RPI 3.

### How to setup the Raspberry Pi

* Download a RASPBIAN image from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
* Follow [these instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) to install the RASBIAN OS. 
* Once the sd card is ready and the system has rebooted.

* Now you need to open the Raspberry Pi Config screen using the `raspi-config` program you will have used when you first set up your Raspberry Pi.
   ```
   sudo raspi-config
   ```  
The `sudo`  is required because you will be changing files that you do not own as the `pi` user.

#### Moving around the menu

>Use the `up` and `down` arrow keys to move the highlighted selection between the options available. Pressing the `right` arrow key will jump out of the Options menu and take you to the `<Select>` and `<Finish>` buttons. Pressing `left` will take you back to the options. Alternatively, you can use the `Tab` key to switch between these.

#### Expand the filesytem

>You will need to reboot the Raspberry Pi to make this available. Note that there is no confirmation: selecting the option begins the partition expansion immediately.

#### Interfacing opitions

##### Enable Camera

>In order to use the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, you must enable it here. Select the option and proceed to `Enable`. This will make sure at least 128MB of RAM is dedicated to the GPU.

##### Enable SSH

>Enable/disable remote command line access to your Pi using SSH.

##### Enable VNC

>VNC is a graphical desktop sharing system that allows you to remotely control the desktop interface of one computer (running VNC Server) from another computer or mobile device (running VNC Viewer). VNC Viewer transmits the keyboard and either mouse or touch events to VNC Server, and receives updates to the screen in return.

You will see the desktop of the Raspberry Pi inside a window on your computer or mobile device. You'll be able to control it as though you were working on the Raspberry Pi itself.

* Execute the following instructions on the command line to download and install the latest kernel, GPU firmware, and applications. You'll need an internet connection for this to work correctly.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
