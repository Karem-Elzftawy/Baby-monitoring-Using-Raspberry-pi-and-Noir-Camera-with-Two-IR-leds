### Raspberry Pi Setup

This guide is tested on RPI 3.

### How to setup the Raspberry Pi

* Download a RASPBIAN image from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
* Follow [these instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) to install the RASBIAN OS. 
* Once the sd card is ready and the system has rebooted.

* Now you need to open the Raspberry Pi Config screen using the `raspi-config` program you will have used when you first set up your Raspberry Pi.
   ```
   sudo raspi-config
   ```  
The `sudo`  is required because you will be changing files that you do not own as the `pi` user.

1. **Moving around the menu**

  Use the up and down arrow keys to move the highlighted selection between the options available. Pressing the right arrow key will jump out of the Options menu and take you to the <Select> and <Finish> buttons. Pressing left will take you back to the options. Alternatively, you can use the Tab key to switch between these.
