### Raspberry Pi Setup

This guide is tested on RPI 3.

### How to setup the Raspberry Pi

* Download a RASPBIAN image from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
* Follow [these instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) to install the RASBIAN OS. 
* Once the sd card is ready and the system has rebooted.

* Now you need to open the Raspberry Pi Config screen using the `raspi-config` program you will have used when you first set up your Raspberry Pi.
   ```
   sudo raspi-config
   ```  
The `sudo`  is required because you will be changing files that you do not own as the `pi` user.
